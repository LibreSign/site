    "### Advanced security for public companies\n\nIn a digital environment where information security is crucial, especially for public companies that deal with large volumes of sensitive documents, LibreSign stands out for offering advanced security. Using data encryption and multi-factor authentication, LibreSign ensures that your data is always protected.\n\n#### See some advantages:\n\nEnd-to-end encryption\nEnd-to-end encryption ensures that only authorized recipients can access and read document content. With LibreSign, each document is encrypted from submission to final signature, ensuring your information remains secure every step of the way.\n\nThis encryption protects against interception during the transmission and storage of documents, ensuring that even if the data is accessed by third parties, it will be indecipherable and useless. For public companies that frequently deal with confidential information, this additional security is essential to protect the integrity of their administrative processes.\n\n#### Secure authentication\n\nLibreSign implements multi-factor authentication (MFA), making unauthorized access difficult and ensuring that only verified people can sign documents. This method requires users to provide two or more forms of verification before accessing documents, making the signing process more secure and reliable.\n\nFor example, in addition to the password, a code sent to the user's cell phone or email may be required. This additional level of verification prevents unauthorized people from forging signatures or accessing important documents. For public organizations, where accuracy and accountability are paramount, MFA provides an indispensable extra layer of security.\n\n### The importance of digital security in public companies\nPublic companies deal daily with information that requires the highest level of security. From contracts and agreements to legislative documents and citizen records, protecting this data is crucial. Any security breach can result in serious consequences, including data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information and damage to the organization's reputation.\n\nLibreSign was developed with a focus on security and efficiency. The platform ensures that each document goes through a secure process, from creation to final signature. This level of detail and care is especially important in a scenario where reliability and security are mandatory.\n\n### Additional Benefits of LibreSign\nIn addition to advanced security features, LibreSign offers other advantages that make document management more efficient and secure:\n\n- **Intuitive interface:** The platform is easy to use, allowing employees to focus on their main tasks without wasting time on complicated systems.\n- **Real-time monitoring:** Track the status of documents in real time, allowing quick actions such as sending reminders for pending signatures.\n- **Integration with other systems:** LibreSign can be integrated with other systems used by your organization, providing more cohesive and centralized document management.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe security of your documents cannot be compromised. With LibreSign, you are guaranteed maximum protection through end-to-end encryption and authentication with multiple identification factors. Our solution is developed to meet the stringent security requirements of public companies, ensuring that each document is treated with the highest level of integrity and reliability.\n\nDon't wait until a security breach affects your organization.

    "### Validity of Legal Signatures in Brazil and Around the World\n\nWith the increasing digitalization of administrative and legal processes, the validity of electronic signatures has become a topic of great relevance. Digital signatures offer security, agility, and convenience, but it is essential to understand their legal basis both in Brazil and in other countries. In this article, we explore the legal validity of digital signatures in a global context.\n\n#### Legal Signatures in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, the validity of electronic signatures is provided for by [Provisional Measure No. 2,200-2/2001](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/MPV/Antigas_2001/2200-2.htm), which established the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure (ICP-Brasil). This measure establishes that digitally signed documents using certificates issued by accredited authorities have the same legal validity as physically signed documents.\n\n**Article 10 of MP 2,200-2/2001:**\n\"Electronic documents referred to in this Provisional Measure, whose signatures were made using a digital certificate issued by an accredited Certification Authority, are considered public or private documents.\"\n\nAdditionally, [Law No. 14,063/2020](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2019-2022/2020/Lei/L14063.htm) brought important updates on the use of electronic signatures in the public sector, classifying them into three types: simple, advanced, and qualified, with the latter having the highest level of security and legal validity.\n\n#### Legal Signatures Around the World\n\nThe regulation of electronic signatures varies from country to country, but there is a global movement towards their acceptance and validation.\n\n##### European Union\n\nIn the European Union, the [eIDAS Regulation](https://s.librecode.coop/e-idas-regulation) (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services), in effect since 2016, standardizes the use of electronic signatures among Member States. The eIDAS recognizes three types of electronic signatures: simple, advanced, and qualified, with the latter being the only one that has legal equivalence to handwritten signatures.\n\n**Article 25 of the eIDAS Regulation:**\n\"A qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature.\"\n\n##### United States\n\nIn the United States, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ([E-SIGN Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/1714)) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) establish that electronic signatures are legally valid and enforceable, provided that all parties involved in the contract opt to use electronic means.\n\n**Section 101(a) of the E-SIGN Act:**\n\"A signature, contract, or other record relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.\"\n\n#### Benefits of Digital Signatures\n\nThe adoption of digital signatures offers several benefits for businesses and institutions:\n\n1. **Security:** They use encryption to ensure the authenticity and integrity of documents.\n2. **Efficiency:** They reduce the time required to sign and process documents.\n3. **Sustainability:** They decrease paper usage, contributing to more sustainable practices.\n\n\nDigital signatures represent a significant advancement in the way documents are managed and authenticated. Their legal validity is supported by specific laws both in Brazil and in other countries, providing security and efficiency for businesses and individuals.\n\nFor more information on the validity of digital signatures in Brazil, visit [ICP-Brasil](http://www.iti.gov.br/icp-brasil) and [Law No. 14,063/2020](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2019-2022/2020/Lei/L14063.htm).\n": "### Validity of Legal Signatures in Brazil and Around the World\n\nWith the increasing digitalization of administrative and legal processes, the validity of electronic signatures has become a topic of great relevance.

Stored on devices like tokens, smart cards, or in the cloud, the certificate is essential for ensuring legitimacy in digital signatures.\nA unique feature of LibreSign is its ability to generate its own Certification Authority. By opting for this feature, users receive a certificate generated internally by the system, streamlining the process and adding innovation and efficiency. The Certification Authority self-generated by LibreSign provides a secure and efficient solution, aligned with the standards of ICP-Brasil.\nSecurity and legal validity are paramount in each signature carried out by LibreSign, ensuring compliance with the rigorous standards established by ICP-Brasil. This guarantees the authenticity and legality of each signed document, meeting and exceeding the expectations of businesses in various sectors, including government, education, and corporate enterprises.\n\nLibreSign is redefining the future of digital signatures, inviting you to be part of this revolution. Join us to explore a new level of experience in electronic signatures.\n",
